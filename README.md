### OFF, Open source Finite volumes Fluid dynamics code

> OFF is a CFD code designed to be accurate, efficient and modular for solving, numerically, the Navier-Stokes equations of fluid dynamics by means of Finite Volume technique. It is written in standard (compliant) Fortran 2008 by means of OOP paradigm. OFF can be executed on parallel CPU-based architecture (shared memory multi-cores workstation, distributed memory cluster and hybrid distributed memory cluster based on shared memory nodes).

A pure Fortran CFD solver for general purpose fluid dynamics problems

- OFF is a pure Fortran program;
- OFF is Fortran 2008+ standard compliant;
- OFF is OOP designed.
